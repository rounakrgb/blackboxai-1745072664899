# Speech2Code Learning Platform

## Project Overview
The **Speech2Code Learning Platform** is a web-based application designed to help users learn programming through speech recognition technology. This platform allows users to speak code commands, which are transcribed into written code in real-time. It offers an intuitive interface that incorporates learning tips, speech history tracking, and mobile responsiveness.

## Installation
To run the Speech2Code Learning Platform locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Speech2Code-Learning-Platform
   ```

2. **Open the HTML file**:
   Open `speech-to-code-learning-platform.html` in your preferred web browser.

**Note**: Internet access is required for loading external resources such as fonts and the Tailwind CSS framework.

## Usage
1. Open the web page in a compatible browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended).
2. Click the **Start Listening** button to begin dictating code.
3. Speak your code commands clearly, using programming keywords.
4. Click the button again to stop the recognition.
5. Review and edit the generated code as necessary.
6. Access your speech history by clicking on the history icon.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Real-time voice recognition converts spoken language into code.
- **Learning Tips**: Provides helpful hints to improve speech input accuracy.
- **Speech History**: Tracks and displays a history of previously spoken commands.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean design with easy navigation.
